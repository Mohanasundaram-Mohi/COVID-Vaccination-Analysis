# COVID Vaccination Analysis - Dashboard

I've just finished analysing the COVID Vaccination Analysis. My dynamic Power BI dashboards delve deep into factors that help to understand the COVID Vaccination index, manufacturing and global daily vaccination numbers. 

 ## Here's what you can expect from this dashboard:

🛠️ Toolkit: Power BI, Microsoft Excel

📊 Datasets: Microsoft Excel

Project Overview:

1. Count of the vaccine by vaccines and country. 
2. People fully vaccinated and manufacture vaccine statistics 
3. Vaccination production company wise and average vaccination country wise.
